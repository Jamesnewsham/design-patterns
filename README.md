# HMRC Design Patterns

This is a place to propose new patterns and discuss existing ones for HMRC Design Patterns.

## Proposing a new pattern

First [check our backlog](https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns/issues), to see if your pattern has already been proposed. If it has, you can add your findings by commenting on the issue. If it has not, you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns/issues/new).

All new patterns must be [useful and unique](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/#new-proposals).

## Discussing existing patterns

You can suggest improvements to existing patterns by commenting on the issue.

## Support

If you have a question, idea or suggestion you can [email the Service Design Tools team](hmrc-service-design-tools-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk).
