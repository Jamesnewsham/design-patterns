# HMRC Design Patterns

This is a place to propose new patterns and discuss existing ones for HMRC Design Patterns.

## New patterns

[Check our backlog](https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns/issues) to see if the pattern you need is already being worked on. If it is, add your findings to the issue. If it has not, [create a new issue](https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns/issues/new).

All patterns must be [useful and unique](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/#new-proposals).

## Existing patterns

Comment on the issue to suggest improvements or add findings.

## Support

If you have a question, idea or suggestion you can [email the Platform UI team](mailto:platform-ui@digital.hmrc.gov.uk).
