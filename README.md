# HMRC design pattern documentation
This repo contains examples of design patterns used in HMRC services.

**These patterns should not be used in production services at the moment this is just a prototype to help documenting patterns**

## Documenting patterns
If you are working on a pattern for an HMRC service and it's not covered in the [issues](https://github.com/hmrc/design-language-documentation/issues) in this repo please create an issue.
