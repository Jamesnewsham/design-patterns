# Contribute to the HMRC Design System

Design your service using [GOV.UK styles, components and patterns](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design). If the thing you need is not there, you should use the [HMRC Design System](http://hmrc.github.io/assets-frontend/). If you still cannot meet the needs of your users proven by user research, then you can:

* adapt an existing component or pattern
* design a new component or pattern
* suggest a new component or pattern

Styles should not be changed unless there is a good reason proven by user research. Work with GDS to agree any changes or improvements.

## How to contribute 

To suggest or share a new or adapted component or pattern, you should [raise an issue](https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns/issues/new) on the [HMRC Design Patterns repository](https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns). This is on Github, but it is easy to do. You must have a github.com account. 

First, [search and check if there is an issue](https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns/issues) for your component or pattern. 

If there is an issue, add your findings. 

If there is not, use the [issue template](https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns/issues/new) to provide as much information as possible about the component or pattern.

When you contribute a component or pattern, explain how it meets the GOV.UK Design System criteria of being [useful and unique](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system/wiki/The-design-system-standard) and include any user research findings. You must do this before it can be included in the HMRC Design System.

A member of the [HMRC Design System Working Group](https://github.com/orgs/hmrc/teams/design-system-working-group) will respond to your issue.
