## Reporting issues

Before you report an issue please search through the issues to avoud duplication.

If you find a problem that can't be solved by something in the design system you should create an issue. You don't have to be doing the work to create an issue, it's enough to see something somone else is doing. Creating an issue helps everyone understand that we think there's a problem that needs to be solved.

When you create the issue please provide as much information as you can. However we appreciate that we may not always have a lot of detail around a problem so simply saying that you think there is a problem that needs to be solved is enough. For example: We don't have a consistent way of doing x, is perfectly valid.
